`web-component-shell-demo`
=================

This is a simple demo project to try out different approaches to load Web Components shells while the actual Web Component gets loaded, parsed and attached to a custom tag.

I've created it with simplicity in mind. In this case that means no NPM. The only dependency is LitElement, which I decided to use for the sake of cleaner Web Components definitions, but it's easy to avoid it as well if you find it necessary.
